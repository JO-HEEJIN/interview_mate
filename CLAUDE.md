# Project Rules

## Experiments
- When running any experiment, always ask the user to confirm key parameters (temperature, model, max_tokens, run count, etc.) before proceeding. Never set arbitrary values without approval.

## Git
- Never add Claude as co-author in commits. No "Co-Authored-By" or "Generated with Claude Code" lines.
