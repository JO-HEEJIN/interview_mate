# Kenneth Interview Script - Option B (Honest Approach)

## 🎯 Critical: First 3 Minutes (Memorize This)

### When Kenneth asks: "Tell me about yourself"

**Your exact script:**

> "I'm Heejin Jo, and I've been building AI systems for startups, with a focus on vulnerable user populations like mental health and agriculture.
>
> The project I've invested most deeply in is Birth2Death, a mental health AI platform. Built a visionOS MVP with a co-founder, now planning iOS launch.
>
> **Before we go further, I need to clarify something about my resume.** I used AI to help write my resume and cover letter based on my real technical work, and it optimized the metrics—projecting capacity as if they were actual user numbers. I submitted without carefully reviewing, and realized too late that it had inflated claims.
>
> That was my mistake. I should have verified every line. The technical architecture is real, but the user metrics aren't.
>
> I'm bringing this up because, one, integrity matters, especially at OpenAI, and two, this taught me a critical lesson about AI outputs that I'd bring to this role: always verify, never blindly trust."

**Key delivery tips:**
- ✅ Say this in **first 90 seconds** of the interview
- ✅ Clear, confident tone (not apologetic or defensive)
- ✅ Make eye contact (if video)
- ✅ Brief pause after, then transition to technical details
- ❌ Don't over-explain or keep apologizing

## Possible Reactions from Kenneth

### Reaction A: Appreciates honesty ✅ (Best case)

**Kenneth:** "Okay, I appreciate you clarifying that. Tell me more about the technical architecture you built."

**You:** (confident) "Sure! The core challenge was building a cost-effective emotional AI system. I designed a routing architecture—GPT-4 for complex emotional analysis, GPT-3.5 for routine interactions. Added caching layers and prompt optimization. This brought projected costs from 45 cents to 9 cents per conversation. We've stress-tested the architecture thoroughly, just haven't validated at scale yet. But the engineering is sound."

---

### Reaction B: Concerned but wants to hear more 🤔 (Common)

**Kenneth:** "I see. So you haven't launched Birth2Death yet?"

**You:** "Correct. I've built a fully functional visionOS MVP with all core features—emotional AI conversations, crisis detection, personalized coping strategies. The system is production-ready from an engineering perspective, but launching a mental health platform responsibly requires clinical validation and legal compliance that we're still working through. That's actually one reason I'm excited about this role—I can help other startups ship faster while I learned these lessons the hard way."

---

### Reaction C: Skeptical/Probing 🚨 (Worst case)

**Kenneth:** "Why did you put those numbers on your resume if they weren't real?"

**You:** (calm, direct) "I used AI to help write my resume based on my real technical work, and it optimized the metrics—turning capacity projections into what looked like actual user numbers. I submitted without thoroughly reviewing each claim. That was careless. I realized too late what had happened. I'm not making excuses—it was my responsibility to verify every line. I'm learning from it, and I wanted to address it upfront rather than have you discover it later."

---

**Kenneth:** "Why didn't you review it before submitting?"

**You:** "Honestly? I was excited and moved too fast. I trusted the AI output because the technical facts it was based on were all real. That was naive. I learned that AI can optimize in ways that cross ethical lines, and verification is non-negotiable.

But here's what that experience taught me: I'm proceeding with this interview despite the embarrassment because this confirmed why I want to work at OpenAI specifically. The more I researched OpenAI's work on hallucination and accuracy—your process supervision research, the model spec work, your preparedness framework—the more I realized you're the only company taking this seriously at a fundamental level. I experienced this problem firsthand, saw how dangerous it can be, and found that OpenAI is leading the work to solve it. That's the mission I want to be part of—helping customers use AI responsibly because I've lived the consequences of not doing so."

---

**Kenneth:** "How do we know you won't make careless mistakes with customers?"

**You:** "Fair question. This was a wake-up call. I've since implemented a personal rule: verify every AI output, every claim, every metric. Ironically, this mistake taught me exactly what OpenAI customers need to learn—how to use AI responsibly. I can speak to that from lived experience now."

**Kenneth:** "How do I know your technical claims are real?"

**You:** "Fair question. I can show you:
- GitHub repos (commits, architecture)
- NASA Space Apps Challenge Houston Local Award (verifiable - Zein was the local mentor/judge)
- Live demo of Birth2Death MVP
- System architecture diagrams
- Technical deep-dive on any component

The engineering is real. The user metrics weren't. I understand if that's a dealbreaker, but I'd rather be honest than maintain a false narrative."

---

## 🛡️ Defense Strategies for Tough Questions

### "Why should we trust you after this?"

**You:** "Because I'm demonstrating the integrity you'd want in someone advising your customers. I could've stayed quiet and hoped you wouldn't discover this, but that's not who I am. Founders make mistakes—what matters is how we handle them. I'm showing you I can own mistakes and course-correct, which is exactly what I'd help your startup customers do."

---

### "Do you have any other exaggerations in your background?"

**You:** "No. Everything else is verifiable—NASA Space Apps Houston Local Award, Seoul National University education, my technical projects. The only issue is Birth2Death's user metrics. I've learned from this, and I'm committed to complete honesty moving forward."

---

### "How do we know you're not just saying what we want to hear?"

**You:** "You can verify everything:
- Call my references
- Check my GitHub
- Test my technical knowledge live
- Ask me about Korean startups—I'll give you honest insights

I'm not trying to sell you a perfect candidate. I'm showing you someone with real technical skills, genuine market knowledge, and the integrity to admit when I've made a mistake."

---

## ✅ Transition to Strengths (After Honesty Moment)

Once you've addressed the issue, **immediately pivot to your real strengths:**

### 1. Technical Architecture Skills
"Let me show you what I actually built at Birth2Death—the routing system, caching architecture, cost optimization..."

### 2. Korean Market Knowledge
"One thing I'm confident about is Korean startup trends. I've been tracking companies like WERT INTELLIGENCE, Scatter Lab..."

### 3. Founder Empathy
"As a founder myself, I know what it's like when a startup customer says 'we're burning $10K/month on API calls.' I've felt that panic, and I know how to solve it."

### 4. Real Production Experience
"Even though we haven't launched, I've solved real production engineering challenges—latency, cost, safety, scalability..."

✅ "I'm committed to honesty moving forward"

---

## 💪 Confidence Builders

**Remember:**
1. Your technical skills are REAL
2. Your Korean market knowledge is REAL
3. Your founder experience is REAL
4. Your NASA Space Apps Houston Local Award is REAL (Zein can verify)
5. You're showing more integrity by admitting this than 90% of candidates would

**You can still get this job.** Honesty + real competence = competitive candidate.

## 📞 After the Interview

If Kenneth says:
