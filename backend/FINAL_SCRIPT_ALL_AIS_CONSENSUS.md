## 🎯 The Complete 90-Second Opening

This is the final, refined version incorporating feedback from all three AI platforms.

### THE SCRIPT (Memorize the flow, not word-for-word)

```
[PART 1: STRONG OPENING - 30 seconds]

"I'm Heejin Jo, and I'm a startup founder and AI engineer motivated
by technology for human benefit. I've been building AI systems for
vulnerable populations, particularly in mental health.

I built Birth2Death entirely on OpenAI's API and solved the exact
production challenges your customers face—implementing model routing
to reduce unit costs by 80%, maintaining sub-second latency, and
designing the system to scale.


[PART 2: IMMEDIATE CLARIFICATION - 30 seconds]

Before we dive deeper, I need to clarify something important about my resume.

The Birth2Death metrics—specifically the user count and retention data—
were phrased in a way that implies live production usage.

To be completely transparent: the platform is fully engineered and
production-ready, but it hasn't launched publicly yet. Those were
internal targets, not current production metrics.

I should have been clearer about our stage. That's on me.

What I can stand behind confidently is the engineering work itself.

I wanted to address this upfront because I know how much OpenAI values
accuracy and integrity.


[PART 3: PIVOT TO VALUE - 30 seconds]

The architecture, the OpenAI API integration, and the optimization
decisions are all real and documented. I can walk you through the
architecture and the specific tradeoffs I made, if that's helpful.

And that's what I'd bring to this role: I've lived the exact challenges
Korean startups face with OpenAI's platform. I speak founder language
because I am one.

Now I want to help dozens of startups succeed with OpenAI, bringing
both the technical depth and the cultural bridge that Korea's 'First Mover'
AI ecosystem needs."

## 🔑 Why These Specific Phrases Matter

### "internal targets, not current production metrics"
- ✅ Clear engineering language
- ✅ Not defensive or vague
- ✅ Shows you understand the difference

### "That's on me. What I can stand behind confidently is..."
- ✅ Takes responsibility
- ✅ Immediately recovers control
- ✅ Doesn't linger on the mistake

### "I can walk you through the architecture and the specific tradeoffs I made"
- ✅ Signals SA-level thinking
- ✅ Invites technical deep-dive
- ✅ More concrete than "any of it"

## 🎭 Delivery Guide

### Tone for Each Part:

**Part 1 (Strong):**
- Energy level: 8/10
- Pace: Steady, confident
- Eye contact: Direct
- Body language: Open, leaning slightly forward

**Part 2 (Clarification):**
- Energy level: 6/10 (calm, not apologetic)
- Pace: Slightly slower, deliberate
- Pause before starting this part (2 seconds)
- Eye contact: Maintain (shows you're not ashamed)
- Tone: Matter-of-fact, not defensive

**Part 3 (Pivot):**
- Energy level: 8/10 (re-energize)
- Pace: Pick up slightly
- Body language: Lean forward again
- Tone: Enthusiastic about the technical work

## ⚠️ NEVER Say These (All AIs Agree)

### Absolutely forbidden phrases:
- ❌ "AI wrote my resume"
- ❌ "I didn't review it carefully"
- ❌ "I was just excited"
- ❌ "I trusted the AI output"
- ❌ "Everyone exaggerates on resumes"
- ❌ "It's not that big of a deal"

### Don't use technical framing as excuse:
- ❌ "These represent validated capacity..."
- ❌ "Based on unit economics modeling..."
- ❌ "Load testing showed..."

**Why?** These sound like you're still trying to justify the false numbers. Just correct the record and move on.

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes & Responses

### Best Case (60% probability):
**Kenneth:** "I appreciate your honesty. Tell me more about the technical architecture..."

**You:** "Great! So the core challenge was balancing cost and quality for mental health conversations. I designed a routing system where..."

✅ Interview proceeds normally
✅ Your integrity is established
✅ Technical discussion begins

---

### Middle Case (30% probability):
**Kenneth:** "I see. That's concerning. Why did you phrase it that way originally?"

**You:** "In hindsight, I focused too much on showing the system's potential rather than clearly stating our current stage. I learned from this that clarity is more important than appearing impressive. That's actually a lesson I'd bring to customers—help them communicate their capabilities accurately."

⚠️ Harder interview, but still salvageable

---

### Worst Case (10% probability):
**Kenneth:** "I'm sorry, but this is a dealbreaker for us."

**You:** "I understand. Thank you for your time and for the opportunity to clarify. I learned a valuable lesson about accuracy in communication."

❌ Rejection, but dignity intact
✅ Can potentially reapply in 6-12 months with real metrics
✅ No burned bridges

---

## 💪 What Makes You Valuable (Remind Yourself)

**Real, verifiable strengths:**
- ✅ Actual technical architecture (can show code)
- ✅ NASA Space Apps Houston Local Award (Zein can verify)
- ✅ Model routing implementation (real engineering)
- ✅ Cost optimization design (documented)
- ✅ Wyoming LLC (actual company formation)
- ✅ Founder empathy (genuine experience)
- ✅ Korean market knowledge (authentic understanding)
- ✅ OpenAI API expertise (demonstrable)

**What's being corrected:**
- ❌ User count exaggeration
- ❌ Retention metrics (not measured)

**Kenneth is evaluating:**
1. **Integrity** - Can I trust this person? ✅ (You're proactively clarifying)
2. **Technical depth** - Do they have real skills? ✅ (Architecture is real)
3. **Communication** - Will they represent OpenAI well? ✅ (Clear, honest, professional)

## 🔥 Final Checklist Before Interview

### Preparation:
- [ ] Practiced 3-part structure 10+ times out loud
- [ ] Recorded yourself and listened back
- [ ] Timed yourself (should be 85-95 seconds)
- [ ] Practiced maintaining eye contact during Part 2
- [ ] Practiced the transition from Part 2 to Part 3 smoothly
- [ ] Have architecture diagrams ready (if asked)
- [ ] Have GitHub ready to share (if asked)
- [ ] Have Zein's contact info ready for NASA verification

### Mental state:
- [ ] Remember: You're correcting a record, not begging forgiveness
- [ ] Remember: Your engineering is real and valuable
- [ ] Remember: This shows integrity, not weakness
- [ ] Remember: OpenAI values honesty above perfection

### Tone check:
- [ ] Does it sound like "I'm a professional clarifying an error"?
